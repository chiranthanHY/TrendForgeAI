Today, Judson Althoff and I announced that this flagship tech conference is coming back to San Francisco in 2026!
 
By establishing San Francisco as their home, Microsoft is reaffirming what we already know: our city is a global hub of innovation. Ignite’s return adds to a strong year ahead for Moscone Center, which will host 36 major events in 2026—outpacing 2025 and continuing the momentum we’re building across the city.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/7397478257031553024,,0,0,0,0,company:microsoft,2025-12-01T19:41:19.446197
LinkedIn,7397477370787504128,Unknown,,False,"I was so pleased to be joined by customers and partners around the world for Microsoft Ignite with 20,000 attendees joining in San Francisco and 200,000 online. It is an exciting time as we shift from an era of AI Transformation to Frontier Transformation: a holistic reimagining of your business, aligning AI with human ambition to achieve your organization's highest aspirations and potential. By democratizing intelligence—empowered by Copilots and agents—we will help them obsolesce the mundane, unlock creativity, and drive even greater innovation. 

As our customers realize success, we have identified three common themes below with new product announcements aimed at empowering the Frontier Firm:

1.     AI in the flow of human ambition. AI needs to be seamlessly accessible in the tools and solutions people use every day and tied to the key business metrics they use to determine ROI. Work IQ amplifies an individual’s IQ—it is the intelligence layer that enables Microsoft 365 Copilot and agents to know how you work, with whom you work, and the content you collaborate on. 

2.     Ubiquitous innovation. There is a maker in every one of us. The person closest to the challenge is often the best to solve it. Empowering employees with the ability to create AI artifacts in the flow of work and coupling citizen development with IT and professional developers through robust collaboration enables innovate at pace. 

▪️ Foundry IQ is the intelligent connection point between all structured and unstructured knowledge and models that agents need. It is the first large scale implementation of context engineering pulling from multiple sources through a single API.

▪️ Fabric IQ is the semantic layer that agents and apps use to reason with enterprise context across your entire data estate, turning unified data into unified intelligence for decisions. If you are already using Power BI, all pre-existing data modeling will act as an immediate accelerant, giving your agents the unique context that defines how your business runs.

▪️ Microsoft Agent Factory harnesses the power of Work IQ, Foundry IQ, and Fabric IQ through a single metered plan, measuring ROI for AI before you start building agents. You can leverage our forward-deployed engineers, our partners, and our skilling assets to build and deliver agents.

3.     Observability at every layer of the stack. You need to see all AI artifacts and how they are being used in real workflows. Microsoft Agent 365 enables you to observe, manage, and secure your AI agents whether they are created with Microsoft platforms, open-source frameworks, or third-party platforms.

Underpinning these three traits are the fundamental Frontier building blocks of Intelligence + Trust, enabled by Microsoft’s model diverse, open, and heterogenous platforms, we can bring together your organization’s IQ and help you achieve your highest aspirations in the pursuit of Frontier Transformation.

Yesterday during the keynote, we shared how Microsoft is evolving the AI stack to help organizations build agents that are intelligent, trustworthy, and deeply grounded in their business.
 
A big part of this evolution is giving agents the context, data, and oversight they need to operate effectively across the enterprise. We introduced Work IQ, which powers Microsoft 365 Copilot and agents with real-time signals from your files, meetings, messages, and work patterns. Plus, Fabric IQ and Foundry IQ to bring together operational and analytical data to give both agents and people a connected, live view of the business.

1. 👋 Introducing vibe.PowerApps.com — full-stack app generation that's as easy to use as it is enterprise-grade, all new and ready to try now!

2. Apps + Agents = Awesome ✨. M365 Copilot is coming to every app, and every agent is getting app skills with the new Power Apps MCP Server.

A lot​ more detail and some great demos on the blog https://lnkd.in/ePfPfnEg as well as at this Ignite session where we'll tell the whole story cover to cover https://lnkd.in/emCXjEQW

In the meantime, here's what you need to know:

Vibe.PowerApps takes agent-first app development to the next level in a completely new experience. A whole team of agents work together with you to define requirements, data models, and solution architecture... and now the newest agent on the team will code a full-stack application from scratch in minutes. You can give the agents feedback in chat or point and click to get exactly what you want. All the traditional limitations of low code are gone now that an agent team is working for you; beautiful themes, custom styling, advanced interactions and delightful animation are just a few prompts away. It's ready today in public preview for anyone to try — give it a shot!

What's more, apps on the platform are getting a massive agent upgrade. We're bringing the full Microsoft 365 Copilot experience directly into Power Apps, including powerful agents like Researcher and Analyst. This means users can now combine their app context with the rest of their ""Work IQ"" including emails, documents, messages, and more, and ask Copilot to do things like prepare research reports or presentations based on the context of their business data. 

At the same time, we're introducing a new Power Apps MCP Server so any agent can use key capabilities from apps — including agent-centric app skills like intelligent data entry. And as agents do more work autonomously on their own or outside of apps, the upgraded Agent Feed makes it possible to quickly keep tabs across all of their activity.

All this is happening against the backdrop of some awesome advancements in the Managed Platform's ability to govern and host all the new AI-first workloads, as well as some great additions in Copilot Studio and the introduction of Agent 365.

From Work IQ in Microsoft 365 to our agent-driven future, these tools are unlocking potential. And we’re embedding trust at every layer, because innovation without integrity isn’t innovation at all. The world’s platform for this transformation? Azure—engineered for performance, security, and planetary-scale AI.
 
This isn’t just about technology. It’s about Microsoft empowering every person on organization to create, connect, and lead in ways that were unimaginable a decade ago.

LinkedIn,7396584281420115969,Unknown,,False,"What if your browser could actually make your workday easier? Now it can. Today we're announcing Microsoft Edge is the first AI browser in the enterprise - here's why it's about to make a huge difference in your workday:
 
Agent mode: You can finally delegate and get things off your plate - especially those tedious, time-consuming tasks. Edge for Business can take action on your behalf through multi-step workflows like booking travel for that conference or filling out forms. You'll provide input at key decision points and can take over at any time - but it'll take on the heavy lifting for you.
 
Daily Briefing: Cut through the fluff and see what you really need to tackle. Get a curated highlight of meetings, tasks, and priorities for your day, drawing on Microsoft Graph (like Teams and Outlook) and browser context.
 
Multi-tab reasoning: Stop flipping between tabs - and clicking the wrong one. Copilot can analyze content across up to 30 (!) open tabs, whether they’re web pages or internal sites, so you can synthesize several sources or compare different options. This has probably been the most loved update for consumer users, and we're thrilled to bring it to work too.
 
Search your history with natural language: For when you really need that one thing you read, and it's somewhere in hundreds of links you've visited. Just ask ""what's that article I was reading about clean energy growth last week,"" and Copilot can find it.
 
YouTube summarization: No more sitting through an hour-long video for that one minute of information you need. Copilot can summarize the whole thing, or answer questions the content when you're looking for something specific.
 
It's all built on our enterprise foundation with world-class security in every layer of the browser stack, and opt-in for both IT teams and users.
 
Features are in private preview, with public previews coming in February across Windows, Mac, iOS and Android. I can't wait for you to feel the difference.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/7396584281420115969,,0,0,0,0,company:microsoft,2025-12-01T19:41:19.446312

LinkedIn,7394421412054179840,Unknown,,False,"Today we announced our new Fairwater datacenter in Atlanta, connected with our first Fairwater site in Wisconsin and our broader Azure footprint to create the world’s first AI superfactory.

Fairwater exemplifies our vision for a fungible fleet: infra that can serve any workload, anywhere, on fit-for-purpose accelerators and network paths, with maximum performance and efficiency.

AI workloads have evolved beyond large-scale pre-training. Today, they encompass fine-tuning, reinforcement learning (RL), synthetic data generation, evaluation pipelines, and more. Fairwater is built to support this full lifecycle:

Max density: Fairwater’s two-story design and liquid cooling system lets us place racks in three dimensions and pack them with GPUs as densely as possible, minimizing cable runs and improving latency and effective bandwidth.

Fleet: Each Fairwater DC can integrate hundreds of thousands of the latest NVIDIA GPUs into a single coherent cluster. This provides flexible infra that can support the full spectrum of workloads, and ensure no GPU is left unnecessarily idle.

And that’s on top of the more than 100,000 GB300s coming online this quarter alone for inference across the rest of our fleet. For us, it’s all about turning every gigawatt into the maximum number of useful tokens. Not every GW is created equal!

Planet-scale: Every Fairwater DC will connect through our continent-spanning AI WAN to prior generations of AI supercomputers, forming a truly fungible pool of compute. This enables developers to scale beyond the capacity of a single site and dynamically land workloads on the right infra for their needs.

Together, these innovations let us bring together different generations of silicon and AI systems across DCs and geos into a single elastic system that scales seamlessly across training and inference workloads

And this elastic AI capacity is all available alongside all the other cloud services (compute, storage, databases, app services) that AI agents and workloads need.

This is what we mean when we talk about building a fungible fleet – a single, unified platform that pushes the limits of performance per watt and per dollar.

LinkedIn,7392234906141163520,Unknown,,False,"Here’s a question that’s not getting the attention it deserves: what kind of AI does the world really want? I think it's probably the most important question of our time. For several years now, progress has been phenomenal. If AGI is often seen as the point at which an AI can match human performance at all tasks, then superintelligence is when it can go far beyond that performance.
 
Instead of endlessly debating capabilities or timing, it's time to think hard about the purpose of technology, what we want from it, what its limitations should be, and how we’re going to ensure this incredible tech always benefits humanity.
 
At Microsoft AI, we’re working towards Humanist Superintelligence (HSI): incredibly advanced AI capabilities that always work for, in service of, people and humanity more generally. We think of it as systems that are problem-oriented and tend towards the domain specific. Not an unbounded and unlimited entity with high degrees of autonomy – but AI that is carefully calibrated, contextualized, within limits.
 
To do this we have formed the MAI Superintelligence Team, led by me as part of Microsoft AI. We want it to be the world’s best place to research and build AI, bar none. We are doing this to solve real concrete problems and do it in such a way that it remains grounded and controllable. We are not building an ill-defined and ethereal superintelligence; we are building a practical technology explicitly designed only to serve humanity.
 
Our recent work demonstrates the value of this narrower form of domain specific superintelligence. The New England Journal of Medicine includes a Case Challenge in every issue – a list of symptoms and a patient to diagnose. It’s fiendishly difficult even for domain experts, let alone the average doctor. Our orchestrator, MAI-DxO, managed to reach 85% across the Case Challenges. Human doctors max out at about 20%, and need to order many more expensive tests. In our view both clinicians and patients alike would welcome the extra support. This work just hints at the potential to revolutionize healthcare. (More here: https://lnkd.in/eSZ8m6T8)
 
Superintelligence could be the best invention ever – but only if it puts the interests of humans above everything else. Only if it’s in service to humanity. Ultimately what HSI requires is an industry shift in approach. Are those building AI optimizing for AI or for humanity, and who gets to judge?
 
At Microsoft AI, we believe humans matter more than AI. We want to build AI that deeply reflects our wider mission to empower every person on the planet.  
 
Humanist, applied - this is the superintelligence I believe the world wants. It’s the superintelligence I want to build. And it’s what we’re going to build on MAI’s Superintelligence Team.

It starts with building real connections and showing genuine enthusiasm for what’s possible in someone’s career. It means knowing your team’s strengths and aspirations — and creating space for them to align their purpose with the company’s mission. And it includes investing in development through honest conversations, meaningful support, and a culture that makes learning possible.

Onstage with Jeff Nelson, we unpacked this strange, thrilling time we're in with AI. You have people at all extremes - AI is underwhelming, or the apocalypse, or utopia.

Two things can be true: AI development should accelerate. And we should be afraid of AI.

If you're not afraid of AI, you don't really understand it. The fear is healthy and the skepticism is necessary. We don't need unbridled accelerationism.

We need caution and care and guardrails, whilst at the same time knowing that this is going to change the world for the better and it does need to accelerate.

Because if we get it right, AI could unlock incredible abundance. Dramatically reduce the cost of living, invent new more effective drugs and treatments, improve education and opportunity for everyone.

These are not contradictions. The risk and reward go hand in hand. Finding our way forward means acknowledging both. Means ensuring human interests come first, always. Means even as we innovate, defining what we WON'T do.

Leaving the conference so inspired, so energized - lots more writings and brain dumps to come.

A coach-like manager doesn’t just direct the work — they develop the people doing it.

It starts with setting clear priorities and explaining the why behind them, so your team understands how their work fits into the bigger picture. It’s about enabling others to succeed — not just within the team, but across the wider organisation. And it means making space for learning, feedback, and growth even when the pace picks up.

When managers coach well, people don’t just perform better. They feel better, too.

LinkedIn,7389436489937494016,Unknown,,False,"Just wrapped our earnings call and wanted to share a few highlights from the quarter. 

Bottom line: We’ve got great momentum across our AI platform and our family of Copilots, fueling our increasing investments in both capital and talent.

We’re building a planet-scale cloud and AI factory.

We’ll increase our AI capacity by 80% this year, and nearly double our DC footprint over the next two.

That includes Fairwater in Wisconsin, the world’s most powerful AI datacenter, which will scale to two gigawatts alone.

We are building a fungible fleet that spans every stage of the AI lifecycle and is constantly optimized to deliver the best ROI and TCO for us and our customers.

One example: during the quarter, we increased the token throughput for GPT-4.1 and GPT-5 by more than 30% per GPU.

Our family of Copilots and agents also surpassed over 150 million monthly active users across high value domains:

• Information work: 90 percent of the F500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot – and we’re shipping updates very fast
• Coding: GitHub Copilot now has 26 million-plus users
• Security: 36+ agents integrated across Entra, Defender, Purview, Intune
• Science & Health: We helped document 17 million-plus patient encounters, up 5X year over year
• Consumer: Tons of new capabilities announced over the past two weeks, from Groups and Mico in Copilot, to ""Hey Copilot"" in Windows

And this week, we signed a new agreement with OpenAI, a milestone for both companies. 

It’s been an incredible investment, with nearly 10X return and no carry. All the value goes straight to shareholders.

Another thing I feel super proud about is that Microsoft is now behind two of the largest nonprofits in the world!

AI that's social instead of isolating.
 
AI that helps you connect with your real-world relationships, instead of roleplaying romance.
 
AI that supports to show up in the real world, instead of pulling you away from it.
 
AI that helps bring out the best in us, not the worst.
 
Because AI should work for humans. Never the other way around.

Copilot Groups: Invite up to 32 friends, classmates, or teammates to a shared conversation and brainstorm, co-write, plan, or study together. Copilot will keep everyone on the same page by summarizing threads, proposing options, tallying votes, and splitting tasks.
 
Mico: A super expressive, customizable visual character - one that can listen, react, and even change colors if you opt in. And there may or may not be a pretty fun easter egg the team built in…
 
Copilot Mode in Edge: An AI browser built the way your brain actually works, combining Voice, Vision, and Actions for a next-level, seamless browsing experience.

In her role as a Product Manager on the User Protection team in Brazil, Googler Rebeca’s job is to ensure people’s safety when using our products. “My focus is on solving common abuse types in Google products, at scale,” she explains. ""My core work involves partnering with the teams behind Google products like Maps, Blogger, and Messages. I focus on two key areas: driving adoption, to ensure as many products as possible are protected by our safety platform, and expanding coverage, to make sure we can solve for the most common types of abuse they face.""

This type of work requires constant strategic adjustment. ""Adaptability is crucial,” Rebeca shares. “The scale at Google means new data, new user trends, and new technologies emerge constantly. Being able to quickly learn and adjust your strategy is essential to keeping up and staying effective.""

The power of her team's mission has also fueled her personal growth when it came to her fear of public speaking — giving her the courage to speak at an internal conference.

LinkedIn,7395109248243757059,Unknown,,False,"When I’m asking friends, family, or a store associate for fashion ideas, I don’t just say: “work bag.”  Instead I say what I’m *really* after, like: “I’m looking for a black leather work bag that’s comfortable, fits my laptop, and is appropriate for customer meetings.” 💼

Now with AI, technology is finally catching up to how we actually shop!  At Google, we're leading this shift with AI that’s both conversational and agentic – meaning you can say what you want and then it’ll help you buy it: 

→ Conversational: You can ask a shopping question in AI Mode (and follow up conversationally to refine), and get an AI-organized response that brings together rich visuals and all the details you need (like price, reviews, and inventory info). 

And we’re also bringing new shopping features to the Gemini app!

Put another way, welcome to the era of ""vibe shopping"" :)

→ Agentic: Our agentic AI can call nearby businesses to check on products (like if the store has what you’re looking for in-stock) and promotions.  

And with agentic checkout, Google can track an item’s price and when the price drops for eligible merchants, you can give Google permission to complete the purchase for you. 

These updates are designed to support a thriving ecommerce ecosystem.  Shoppers get to delegate the tedious parts of online shopping (but keep the fun and control!), and merchants can capture high-intent sales that might have otherwise been abandoned. 

It’s pretty awesome to see advancements like these even change my own shopping behavior.  This is the bag I ended up getting… with a very cute model, our cat Paris :)

LinkedIn,7387607832843567105,Unknown,,False,"Over the past two weeks, we've seen a flurry of new results from Google Research, from genomics to quantum computing to geospatial understanding.

These breakthroughs exemplify what I call the “magic cycle” of research: addressing global challenges and opportunities with foundational research that leads directly to real-world applications and solutions. These solutions not only benefit millions around the world, but they also uncover more important problems to solve.

Research is our chance—and imperative—to improve day-to-day lives, and address societal challenges and opportunities, and it means that research and innovation is never 'done.' 

Three highlights on latest from Google Research in collaboration with other teams:

✨ Fighting Cancer with AI 
Our decade-long effort in genomics led to DeepSomatic, an AI-powered tool that accurately spots genetic variants in cancer cells. Our partners used it to identify 10 new genetic variants in childhood leukemia samples that were missed by previous techniques, advancing personalized treatment. Separately, the Cell2Sentence-Scale 27B model successfully generated a novel, validated hypothesis for a combination cancer therapy.

✨ Verifiable Quantum Advantage 
We demonstrated the Quantum Echoes algorithm on our Willow chip. This marks the world's first verifiable quantum algorithm that brings us a step closer to practical applications of quantum computing, such as designing better materials and medicines, by more precisely modeling quantum behavior that classical supercomputers cannot.

✨ Understanding Earth 
Our new initiative, Earth AI, focuses on synthesizing disparate geospatial information and predictive models. This multi-year effort will make it possible to tackle complex planetary science and crisis resilience questions—like precisely predicting vulnerable communities and infrastructure during an impending storm, or help in complex logistics planning—that are currently impossible to answer due to the complexity of integrating diverse data.

The magic cycle is accelerating significantly, powered by stronger models, and agentic tools, like AI co-scientist and AI-based expert-level empirical software. And it applies across many disciplines and domains.

Today, the energy was palpable at our flagship Research@ event in Mountain View. The opportunity to advance research and AI is greater than ever and I’m excited about how AI can be an amplifier of human ingenuity.

🚀 In our talk, Spurs CEO, RC Buford and I will discuss what drives the organization's willingness to innovate ahead of the curve, and how being pioneer adopters of AI technology benefits the team, and their community.

📣 Jordan Kolosey and Charlie Kurian will give us an update and share all of the new ways the Spurs will bring AI into fan and community experiences through Sora and ChatGPT at home games! 

🏅 The Spurs are widely known as a trusted community anchor in South Texas — a team that shows up for families, youth, and community organizations across our region. I really see the Spurs' playing a significant role in boosting AI literacy in their  community. Integrating AI into their business workflows, and especially the fan experience helps people feel more confident, empowered, and excited about emerging technology — not just in the arena, but in their daily lives. 

Given what Karin Kimbrough and Aaron ""Ronnie"" Chatterji recently shared about the future of work, and AI literacy as a skill in high demand, the Spurs' role in educating their community is truly important, and ground breaking. 

I can't wait to continue to tell their story in our community.

LinkedIn,7394817666877886464,Unknown,,False,"We’ve developed a new way to train small AI models with internal mechanisms that are easier for humans to examine and understand.

Language models like the ones behind ChatGPT have complex, sometimes surprising internal structures, and we don’t yet fully understand how they work. 

This approach is an early step toward closing that gap, and a part of a broader set of efforts across OpenAI to make our systems more interpretable—developing methods that help us understand why a model produced a given output. In some cases that means looking at the model’s step-by-step reasoning, and in others it means trying to reverse-engineer the small circuits inside the network. 

There’s still a long path to fully understanding the complex behaviors of our most capable models.

Today we’re announcing that U.S. servicemembers and veterans can receive a free year of ChatGPT Plus if they’re within 12 months of retirement or separation.

This effort was driven by veterans at OpenAI,  including me, who’ve seen firsthand how these tools can make the transition to civilian life a little easier.

I’m an AI Adoption Manager at OpenAI and a 20-year US Army veteran. When I left the military, I didn’t have a traditional tech background. I relied on ChatGPT early on to bridge the gap, learning cloud concepts, translating technical jargon, and gaining the confidence to navigate a new career path. Over time, I went from user to power user to someone helping public-sector teams understand how to think with AI.

That journey ultimately brought me to OpenAI, where I work every day to help governments and public servants use frontier AI responsibly and effectively.

If AI helped me build a new career, I know it can help others do the same. Proud to have helped bring this initiative to life — and excited for what it can unlock for those who’ve served.

Here’s my idea/plan: [insert].
Act as a critical thinker — question my assumptions, challenge the logic, and highlight any blind spots I might be missing. Stress test my reasoning and point out weaknesses, but don’t rewrite or change the original idea itself.

Prompt 2: Reframe Through a Different Lens
Here’s the core idea: [insert].
Reframe it from different angles — for example, shift to a new audience POV, explore an emotional trigger, or create a different positioning strategy.
Show me fresh perspectives I might not have considered, while keeping the main essence intact.

Prompt 3: Structure My Messy Ideas
Here’s a messy brain dump: [insert].

Prompt 4: Spot Hidden Assumptions
Here’s my plan: [insert].
Identify the hidden assumptions I might be making — especially the ones that are risky, flawed, or could simply be wrong. Help me see where I may be overconfident, what I’m taking for granted, and what could undermine my plan if left unchecked.

Prompt 5: Stress-Test With Scenarios
Here’s my strategy: [insert].
Show me 3 best-case scenarios, 3 worst-case scenarios, and 3 likely scenarios.
Explain how each outcome could realistically unfold, and what that would mean for the success or failure of my overall strategy.

Prompt 6: Play Devil’s Advocate
Here’s my plan: [insert].
Argue against it as if you completely disagree. Be blunt, direct, and brutally honest. Tell me what the critics would say, where they’d find the weak spots, and why my plan might not work at all.

LinkedIn,7379540376241688576,Unknown,,False,"OpenAI, calm down. I can only type so fast. Let’s cover the new releases and why they matter:

Since last Thursday, OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Pulse, Commerce in chat, parental controls, and Sora 2 + Sora app.

Here’s the full rundown:

→ ChatGPT Pulse (preview): Pro users on mobile can now get a daily, proactive research cards based on your chats, feedback, and optional calendar. You can thumbs-up/down and curate what shows next. Why does this matter? AI is getting more proactive! You won’t have to prompt all the dang time!

→ Commerce in chat: OpenAI rolled out Instant Checkout using the open Agentic Commerce Protocol (built with Stripe). You can already buy from U.S. Etsy sellers inside ChatGPT, with Shopify merchants “coming soon.” Why does this matter? ChatGPT was already being used to shop and browse, now it’s going fully vertical. More “complete” experiences will happen inside ChatGPT.

→ Parental controls: New teen safety features now let parents link accounts, set limits, and dial down sensitive content. It’s imperfect (and will evolve), but this seems to be the most concrete teen-focused guardrail set we’ve seen from them to date. Why does this matter? AI is becoming more integrated into our personal lives and full families are signing up for it as an app they use together, this was the obvious next step.

→ Sora 2 + Sora app: A major step-up in physical realism and control, now with synced dialogue/SFX, plus a new (currently) invite-only iOS app that looks and feels like TikTok, but for AI-generated video only. Cameos let friends appear with consent and revocable control. Available in US/Canada first. Why does this matter? Meta and TikTok own a huge part of the commerce chain because of a social-first strategy, OpenAI wants a piece of the pie.

Overall: more proactive and personalized systems, more vertical integration, more connections with family and friends, and more weirdness still to come.

What say you on these releases?

LinkedIn,7355673820441006083,Unknown,,False,"In front of an online audience of thousands last Thursday, OpenAI’s head recruiter, Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, described one of the common threads that draws talent to the company: OpenAI’s culture. 

“We’re a culture of doers who do things – with autonomy, with agency,” he said at the OpenAI Forum. “There’s no sitting around asking for permission.” 

Joaquin also mentioned how OpenAI’s mission is attractive to candidates. “We’re building AGI, and we’re bringing it to humanity in a way that’s responsible and beneficial.” And he explained how it’s the people at OpenAI who draw talent to the company. “We often say good people draw good people. And people want to work with like-minded people … people who, you know, want to jump into the deep-end and into the unknown.” 

Joaquin’s comments came during an hourlong conversation at the OpenForum titled: “Careers at the Frontier: Hiring the Future at OpenAI,” where he discussed his own career trajectory – stints at Facebook and LinkedIn before coming to OpenAI to work on AI safety and even a three-month turn as an intern on the company’s health team. 

Joaquin’s current role at OpenAI is Head of Recruiting, and he explained why he made the move to the post. “Although OpenAI is about 10 years old, in many ways we’re only getting started now. I feel like we’re at the beginning of building a company that is probably going to be generational,” he said. “It became a no-brainer.”  

When Natalie Cone, who was moderating the conversation as head of the OpenAI Forum Community, asked him what a typical day looks like for his recruiting team, Joaquin replied, “Oh, a typical day is crazy.” He explained: “We have a constantly changing environment. The goals are always changing. We can’t really predict what products would be shipping long term, because the models keep getting more capable. It’s very hard, then, to know how much do different teams need to grow.”

LinkedIn,7353112800933654528,Unknown,,False,"I will officially start at OpenAI as CEO of Applications on August 18. I am sharing this essay on why I believe AI can be the greatest source of empowerment for all. https://lnkd.in/gfrq627N 

I’ve always considered myself a pragmatic technologist — someone who loves technology not for its own sake, but for the direct impact it can have on people’s lives. That’s what makes this job so exciting, since I believe AI will unlock more opportunities for more people than any other technology in history. If we get this right, AI can give everyone more power than ever.

But I also realize those opportunities won’t magically appear on their own.

Every major technology shift can expand access to power – the power to make better decisions, shape the world around us, and control our own destiny in new ways. But it can also further concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few — usually people who already have money, credentials, and connections.

That’s why we have to be intentional about how we build and share these technologies so they lead to greater opportunity and prosperity for more people. The choices we make today will shape whether the coming transformation leads to greater empowerment for all, or greater concentration of wealth and power for the few.

We can start by making sure the keys to empowerment and opportunity — knowledge, health, creative expression, economic freedom, time, and support — are widely available. You can read more in the link I shared about the potential AI has to transform each of these aspects of people’s lives.

If we can make intelligence accessible everywhere, affordable to everyone, and easy to understand, we can drive the biggest opportunity engine the world has ever seen and help more people live better lives. I’m looking forward to building this future alongside my brilliant new colleagues at OpenAI, and I’ll have a lot more to share soon.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/7353112800933654528,,0,0,0,0,company:openai,2025-12-01T19:42:23.002929

Next up in our summer intern spotlight series: Aayan A., a Software Engineer Intern on the Facebook Creators Professional Mode Team. His journey at Meta highlights the valuable impact that interns can have in a short amount of time. 

🌎 Aayan shares first-hand how interning at Meta has given him the opportunity to make impact at scale:

""I chose Meta because of the impact I could have as an engineer here. Meta's products connect nearly half the world and help bring them closer. There is no other place where someone can make such a big impact. Working at Meta has been a rewarding experience as I got to work with people who have solved some of the biggest technical challenges and scaled products from a few hundred users to billions.”

🌱 Beyond impact, Aayan has also experienced significant career growth:

""Interning at Meta has made me an exponentially better engineer — it has taught me how to unblock myself, know when to ask for help, and learn new things quickly. Something that really surprised me was how much autonomy engineers have and how much of the new ideas come bottom-up. Meta empowers its engineers, PMs and designers to constantly improve its products and deliver a better experience to its users.""

Aayan’s story is just one example of how the culture at Meta fosters growth, innovation and autonomy. Stay tuned for more inspiring intern journeys as we continue the series!

Sometimes, the smallest hearts remind the biggest companies what kindness truly looks like. When a four-year-old boy dreamed of having an Amazon-themed birthday party—complete with the thrill of seeing a real delivery van—no one could have imagined that Amazon itself would make that dream come true. Despite being one of the largest and busiest companies in the world, Amazon found the time, heart, and humanity to show up in a deeply personal way. 

On short notice, they didn’t just send one delivery van—they brought two: a classic Amazon delivery van and a cutting-edge electric model. Their team arrived with smiles, good spirits, and arms full of gifts, turning a simple backyard celebration into a once-in-a-lifetime memory. Every child got to climb behind the wheel, honk the horn, and pretend to be an Amazon driver for a day. The laughter, joy, and awe on their faces said everything words could not. 
 
In a world where large corporations often feel distant, Amazon proved that compassion and community still matter. Their thoughtful gesture—done not for publicity, but from genuine goodwill—brought magic to a young boy’s birthday and touched every heart in attendance.

LinkedIn,7399531297678979072,Unknown,,False,"NEWS: IBM just dropped their quantum timeline.

I can't stop thinking about what I saw.

I spent the day at IBM's Technology in Action event in London exploring what enterprise AI and quantum computing look like in practice.

Here's what caught my attention:

1. Quantum Nighthawk processor (announced at the event):

→ 30% more complex circuits than previous generations
→ Each qubit connects to 4 others (vs 2-3 previously)
→ Solves 30-40% larger problems on today's hardware
→ Operations jump from 5,000 today to 100 million when fault-tolerant

The implications are massive: 
• Moderna using quantum to explore medicine design
• HSBC saw 34% increase in successful algorithmic trades
• Problems classical computers can't touch become solvable

2. watsonx Orchestrate for AI agents:

→ One system orchestrating multiple specialised agents
→ Automatically routes to HR, IT, Legal agents based on query
→ Pre-built integrations with ServiceNow, SAP, Salesforce
→ Ferrari using it to generate real-time race insights for millions of fans

IBM's Client Zero strategy (drinking their own champagne):
• $3B in productivity gains unlocked in 2024 
• On track for $4.5B annually 
• Tested across 70 business units and 270,000 employees

My takeaway:

I spoke with Adam Hammond (Business Leader for IBM Quantum EMEA) and Jessica Ridella (Global Technology Managing Director) this week.

Quantum advantage is the point at which quantum computers can solve problems that classical computers alone cannot handle effectively.

IBM expects quantum advantage by 2026 and fault-tolerant by 2029.

But what matters today:

66% of UK businesses are already seeing AI productivity gains, yet 62% admit they're barely scratching the surface.

The gap is now less about capability and more about deployment.

The models are ready. The infrastructure exists. The question is: are you?

IBM's mission today is to enable every organization to become AI-First. And this week at #ThinkParis and #ThinkEhningen, we showcased how IBM is helping Europe’s most ambitious organizations gain a competitive edge. A few examples:

➡️ At L’Oréal we are enabling the creation of a custom genAI foundation model for cosmetic formulation 
➡️ At BNPP we co-developed a multi cloud architecture to scale in this regulated industry 
➡️ At Deutsche Telekom we implemented Concert to accelerate software patch management
➡️ At Atruvia we are advancing automation, data management and operational efficiency

During our Think event in Germany, we also inaugurated the new Technology Campus in Ehningen —a hub for pioneering tech-- alongside Federal Minister for Digital Affairs and State Modernisation, Dr. Karsten Wildberger and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior for Digitisation Thomas Strobl. 

The need to supercharge Europe’s competitiveness has been a central theme this week —from Germany and France to Finland, where our team hosted EU Commission EVP Henna Virkkunen, who shared her vision for accelerating AI and quantum adoption. These critical conversations surrounded the #EUsummit on Digital Sovereignty in Berlin, where Europe’s digital future was front and center. 

These are my key takeaways from this highly energetic week:

➡️ Sovereignty must not be confused with protectionism and isolation. It is about building strengths while creating a collaborative ecosystem of like-minded partners on the basis of freedom of choice.
➡️ Competitiveness requires speed and adaptability. We urge the EU to quickly adopt a “Digital Omnibus” package to remove red tape and show that regulation, done right, can be a catalyst for growth.
➡️ Beyond simplification in the digital space, Europe must create the right incentives to attract and retain talents and find the proper funding for innovation --private and public. 

The path for prosperity is built with bridges, not walls. Let's build an AI-First world together.

Today, I’m excited to announce the five organizations selected to join this new cohort. Together with IBM experts, they will apply IBM’s AI, Cloud, and data technologies to modernize supply chains by reducing costs and expanding access to sustainable infrastructure.  

✔️ Al Baha University, in Saudi Arabia, will develop an AI framework to coordinate fleet management operations in real time, reducing idle times, fuel use, and emissions across logistics hubs. 

✔️ NREL Foundation will collaborate on an AI-enabled “data room” to strengthen resilience across food, energy, and water systems, beginning in Indonesia and expanding across Southeast Asia and the Pacific. 

✔️ Polytechnique Montréal will develop an AI and quantum-enabled decision-support tool for Canada’s forest value chain, improving supply-chain decisions while balancing cost, energy use, and emissions. 

✔️ UNIDO will create a digital solution to assess countries’ readiness for the digital and AI economy, piloting in Brazil and Mexico before scaling globally. 

✔️ World Resources Institute will develop an AI-enabled mapping capability using satellite imagery to detect and classify solar systems, supporting equitable energy-access planning beginning in India, with plans to expand to Kenya and beyond. 

We’re in an era where advanced technologies like AI are moving beyond innovation labs and into communities, helping to solve real infrastructure and sustainability challenges. This new cohort will show what’s possible when we combine global expertise with local insight to build stronger, more resilient supply chains.

I am pleased to share that Jay Gambetta will become Director of IBM Research effective October 1, 2025.

Research is central to IBM. It has been our compass—helping the company and our clients navigate the future of technology. Many of you know Jay as a leader in quantum computing, however, Jay understands that Research succeeds when it delivers value not only to science, but to IBM and our clients. He has shown a strong commitment to making Research a driver of impact across our business. Over the past decade, he has advanced our quantum roadmap—moving from fundamental science to real systems, software, and services that clients are already using to explore new applications. His leadership has helped establish IBM as a leader in both the science and business of quantum while ensuring it becomes a lasting source of value for the company. 

Jay also understands that advancing science and commercializing technology is a team effort. He has recruited and developed talent. He works with the ecosystem of external partners: universities, governments, and enterprises, striving to ensure they get value from the relationship. He has helped build a stellar team and empowers them for success. All of these attributes will serve him well in this larger role. 

I want to thank Darío Gil for his outstanding leadership of IBM Research. A passionate advocate for AI, Darío guided Research to make great strides in AI, quantum, semiconductors, and hybrid cloud. In January, he was nominated to serve as Under Secretary for Science and Innovation at the U.S. Department of Energy, and on September 26 he was sworn into that role. Darío was a great leader for Research, and I am grateful for his vision, his partnership, and his contributions.

Research will continue to focus on what drives IBM: AI, semiconductors, hybrid cloud, quantum, and the mathematics of computing. As always, Research will also focus on the broader frontier of technology, resulting in innovations we have yet to imagine. 

Please join me in congratulating Jay. I know he will bring the same curiosity, discipline, and collaborative spirit that have defined his career to this new chapter for IBM Research.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/7378901562070310912,,0,0,0,0,company:ibm,2025-12-01T19:43:38.788404

💡 Her top tips as a consultant in the public sector:
✔ Understand the mission – Tie every solution back to people and public impact. This keeps teams aligned and helps stakeholders see the bigger picture.
✔ Know the process – Success is also about navigating what sometimes can be complex and confusing compliance and contracting. Knowing the process as well as your clients helps everyone be successful.
✔ Never stop learning – Government clients are often stretched thin, focused on operations, and navigating red tape. As a consultant, it’s your job to bring not just IT expertise — but a deep understanding of their world: policy drivers, regulatory shifts, funding cycles, and how other agencies are solving similar problems.

One of our favorite beginner projects with Qiskit—our open-source quantum SDK—is building a quantum Magic 8 Ball to showcase true randomness.

𝐖𝐡𝐲?
Classical computers use algorithms to simulate randomness, but their answers are ultimately deterministic. So far, these approximations have been “good enough” to power today’s technology. But when it comes to securing personal data or sensitive government information, “good enough” isn’t good enough.

𝐐𝐮𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐮𝐦 𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐦𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐢𝐬 𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭:
In quantum computing, our units of computation, qubits, are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, which are inherently probabilistic. While algorithms like Grover’s and Shor’s can produce deterministic results for specific tasks, quantum measurements remain fundamentally probabilistic, even with complete knowledge of the system’s initial state.

This true randomness enhances use cases such as unpredictability in programming, variability in simulations, and especially cryptography—making protocols even more secure.
